# 3-Phase-Inverter-
This project focuses on the design, simulation, and implementation of a three-phase inverter, a fundamental power electronics circuit used to convert DC power into balanced three-phase AC output. The inverter plays a crucial role in applications such as motor drives, renewable energy systems, and grid-connected power conversion.
